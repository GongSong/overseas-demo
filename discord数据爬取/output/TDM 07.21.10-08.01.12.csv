2022-08-01 12:56:22,2022-08-01,12:56:22,Taskman,It was really well done so far. Few bugs (expected for early alpha) but overall really good compared to some tests I've been in.Lookin forward to future tests and trying to find bugs if it doesn't crash due to overheating the phone 😉, ,,general-chat
2022-08-01 11:50:09,2022-08-01,11:50:09,Lunun,"so yea, sooner or later, there will probably also be a closed or even an open beta", ,,general-chat

2022-08-01 11:47:52,2022-08-01,11:47:52,Lunun,"First things first, thanks for letting me join the Closed Alpha! ❤️Due to the fact that the Alpha is over, I wanted to share general Feedback, some bugs, etc.Everything that comes to my mind, i guess.(because someone will ask, my Device is the ROG Phone 5, I was playing with the ROG Kunai controllers. Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me. So far, the game is very promising.Thanks yet again!", ,,feedback-and-bugs

Just like in division 2 the gunplay is diverse between the gun types, with minor variety within a class. The enemies are tanky. Spongy even. Having to unload a full LMG mag at a purple enemy doesn't feel right. The abilities are very different from one another and from my experience paired well for their specialisations. Specialisations themselves might need to be balanced though, since some seem more useful than others.Gameplay is repetitive. Most looter shooters have either extremely varied, or randomly generated/featuring more RNG. I assume the drop tables will be changed at final release, otherwise people will just farm one or two fastest missions.Even within missions, once I've played them half a dozen times I found myself just prefiering or pretrapping enemy spawn points. Making spawns more varied and/or slightly random might help with that.Exotic gear is much more powerful than standard gear, not just stat-wise, but also by allowing you a different playstyle. I am conflicted on that, as this can be great for character progression, but at the same time being locked into a particular firearm type doesn't sound perfect.", ,,feedback-and-bugs

Since playing on smartphones are a bit tricky compared to the mouse-view mechanic on PC, one could implement recruitable NPCs. After doing some story missions they would be stationed at your personal base. But you could limit recruiting them to only one at a time and only single-playing gamers who are prone to be easily cornered compared to friends playing in a group. Outfitting them with obtained or built weapons & gear would engage and keep the gamers busy. And (let's face it, you knew it) these NPCs could be outfitted with cosmetic clothes as well. These are my thoughts for now.", ,,feedback-and-bugs
2022-07-30 17:42:58,2022-07-30,17:42:58,Sternitzky,"My thoughts about gameplay features. I don't know what features are in the game, but still aren't activated in the Alpha version. Nevertheless I was pondering about features that keep the gamers playing yet to be released The Division: Resurgence. What players keep playing aren't alone friends or foes, the hunt for better weapons & gear or cosmetic clothes. As stated in the questionnaire (yes, I filled it out), even Ubisoft describes the game as a Roleplay Tactical Shooter relying on The Division's praised cover mechanics, so the game stands and falls how particularly the roleplay mechanics are implemented. One of these is base-building, a big deal feature in several successful smartphone games, but also one that was part of the original first title of The Division series. Roleplay features that get you personally attached to keep especially players coming back, who single-play a game (for whatever reason). I don't know whether Resurgence has base-building like The Division 1 or in some different way, but I think Resurgence would definitely benefit from some sort of base-building (again with perks), even if players would get a personal apartment in a skyscraper. Hence we're now at the money-making point, because some sort of base means players can decorate aka personalize it with cosmetic items, if this is one point of income Ubisoft is thinking about. More opportunities for not gameplay-affecting cosmetic items mean simply more income.", ,,feedback-and-bugs

Even though my character level in the bottom left when moving around says 16, and the enemies are all 16.So it seems my weapons were around 6-7 levels under the max I could have upgrade them. If this at all was a contributor, then I think there needs to be a more suitable and consistent character level tracking.Like, how your character level is tied to your max weapon level, but the max weapon level is still 10 higher than your level?I recognise it says ""it increases with your character level"" so could be seen as ""it'll be higher than your max level, but increase alongside it"", but why? That would just add one more hidden (when not at table) stat to keep track of. And every other division game has gone about it that your max leveled weapon is the level equal to your character...But anyways, I feel that still wouldn't explain why all the enemies in the Deadeye mission felt completely fine, but Deadeye themselves felt like shooting at wall and expecting results 🤭", ,,feedback-and-bugs
