I have played on a Pocophone F2 Pro, connected to a mobile network and Wi-Fi, on the beach with the screen and at home with a PS4 controller.  I have only reached level 24.Problems: only one crash and some  lag problems in some macthmaking.Fears: Being a cooperative open world, if the number of players in the streets is not fine-tuned, you may not be able to open any backpack and you may not arrive in time to do any activity.  From what I've seen, the activities respawn in a short time.In love: You have listened to the TD1 community when we asked to be able to have the streets as an open world with other players that are not from our team.  Running in & out of the Main Base is great.  That our character finally speaks is also great.  Now you must remember to include Central Park. 😉Weapons: I have used the same as with TD2, especially AR.  With the shield I thought that Lady Dead would be the best, until I tried the exotic LMG.  It's a combination too deadly .  Having bosses with three types of weakness makes you need three weapin for racha exotic.  It's fun.  The enemies are sponges, yes, it has always been like that, it is part of this game.  There are no guns, although I don't usually use them much.",,feedback-and-bugs

Cant wait to be able to put the graphics to the maximum ! 😀 I've met some clipping only at the first time to Trinity, but the little sessions I've played, I didnt met other clipping or bugs !The only thing I think would be good is, as on The Division 2, to be able to shoot enemies over cars' windows or so, the collision meshs seems to be a little too basic maybe ? =)Cant wait to play to other sessions and see if there will be other specs !Thanks a lot for let me play to this session, it made me addict !

2022-08-01T10:52:40.238000+00:00,211938703591997451,Zycore,"Bugs and feedback I have found:Some backpack or boxes were not able to be interacted with and presented a message saying you are not longer able to interact with this object. Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression. Apart from these Dev bugs the game handles really well for a alpha, the environment can seem a bit choppy and flat at times but that is understandable. I enjoyed my play.",,feedback-and-bugs

Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression. Apart from these Dev bugs the game handles really well for a alpha, the environment can seem a bit choppy and flat at times but that is understandable. I enjoyed my play.",,feedback-and-bugs

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version.

Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression.

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version. Only down side issue that I'm not sure this will be resolved is heating up of the mobile device when playing. Just for the record I got OnePlus 7 Pro with a Snapdragon 855.Looking forward to be part of the next testing fase,,feedback-and-bugs

Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression.

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version. Only down side issue that I'm not sure this will be resolved is heating up of the mobile device when playing. Just for the record I got OnePlus 7 Pro with a Snapdragon 855.Looking forward to be part of the next testing fase,,feedback-and-bugs

Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression.

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version. Only down side issue that I'm not sure this will be resolved is heating up of the mobile device when playing. Just for the record I got OnePlus 7 Pro with a Snapdragon 855.Looking forward to be part of the next testing fase,,feedback-and-bugs

Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression. Apart from these Dev bugs the game handles really well for a alpha, the environment can seem a bit choppy and flat at times but that is understandable. I enjoyed my play.",,feedback-and-bugs

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version. Only down side issue that I'm not sure this will be resolved is heating up of the mobile device when playing. Just for the record I got OnePlus 7 Pro with a Snapdragon 855.Looking forward to be part of the next testing fase,,feedback-and-bugs

Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression. Apart from these Dev bugs the game handles really well for a alpha, the environment can seem a bit choppy and flat at times but that is understandable. I enjoyed my play.",,feedback-and-bugs

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version. Only down side issue that I'm not sure this will be resolved is heating up of the mobile device when playing. Just for the record I got OnePlus 7 Pro with a Snapdragon 855.Looking forward to be part of the next testing fase,,feedback-and-bugs

Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression.

2022-08-01T10:52:40.238000+00:00,211938703591997451,Zycore,"Bugs and feedback I have found:Some backpack or boxes were not able to be interacted with and presented a message saying you are not longer able to interact with this object. Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression. Apart from these Dev bugs the game handles really well for a alpha, the environment can seem a bit choppy and flat at times but that is understandable. I enjoyed my play.",,feedback-and-bugs

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version.

The game play was excellent once I got used to the controls though I did find them a little fiddly when changing the camera angle (kept hitting the fire or one of theskill buttons though I put that down to my fat thumbs) I may have to invest in a controller. I found the missions to be enjoyable and look forward to tackling even more in the finished game and testing out the other skills. The graphics were excellent even with them not being at max quality. A couple of issues I did find was my phone got very hot rather quickly even though it's an almost new phone so couldn't play it for too long in case it damaged my battery. The other issue was once I started playing I didn't want to put it down! All in all this game will be an excellent addition to the division universe.

The game play was excellent once I got used to the controls though I did find them a little fiddly when changing the camera angle (kept hitting the fire or one of theskill buttons though I put that down to my fat thumbs) I may have to invest in a controller. I found the missions to be enjoyable and look forward to tackling even more in the finished game and testing out the other skills. The graphics were excellent even with them not being at max quality. A couple of issues I did find was my phone got very hot rather quickly even though it's an almost new phone so couldn't play it for too long in case it damaged my battery. The other issue was once I started playing I didn't want to put it down! All in all this game will be an excellent addition to the division universe.

2022-08-01T10:01:29.708000+00:00,874655927142326333,R0bn1x0n,I must say I thoroughly enjoyed testing this game and it was even better than I expected. The game play was excellent once I got used to the controls though I did find them a little fiddly when changing the camera angle (kept hitting the fire or one of theskill buttons though I put that down to my fat thumbs) I may have to invest in a controller. I found the missions to be enjoyable and look forward to tackling even more in the finished game and testing out the other skills. The graphics were excellent even with them not being at max quality. A couple of issues I did find was my phone got very hot rather quickly even though it's an almost new phone so couldn't play it for too long in case it damaged my battery. The other issue was once I started playing I didn't want to put it down! All in all this game will be an excellent addition to the division universe. Well done to the team for what you have achieved so far.🙂,,feedback-and-bugs

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me.

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me.

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me.

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast.

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me.

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me.

2022-07-31T18:47:45.337000+00:00,240192175986573313,jestmi,"Final feedback: the gameplay is solid, although repetitive. Just like in division 2 the gunplay is diverse between the gun types, with minor variety within a class. The enemies are tanky. Spongy even. Having to unload a full LMG mag at a purple enemy doesn't feel right. The abilities are very different from one another and from my experience paired well for their specialisations. Specialisations themselves might need to be balanced though, since some seem more useful than others.Gameplay is repetitive. Most looter shooters have either extremely varied, or randomly generated/featuring more RNG. I assume the drop tables will be changed at final release, otherwise people will just farm one or two fastest missions.Even within missions, once I've played them half a dozen times I found myself just prefiering or pretrapping enemy spawn points. Making spawns more varied and/or slightly random might help with that.Exotic gear is much more powerful than standard gear, not just stat-wise, but also by allowing you a different playstyle. I am conflicted on that, as this can be great for character progression, but at the same time being locked into a particular firearm type doesn't sound perfect.",,feedback-and-bugs
