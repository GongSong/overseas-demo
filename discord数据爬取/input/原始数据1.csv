2022-08-01T14:14:45.888000+00:00,379941526589145088,lolo-_-guitarra,"Manufacturing: The system rewards you for manufacturing, so it is mandatory from minute 1, since there are a lot of blueprints to get.  In addition, you have to invest in improving the characteristics of each weapon.  It's very MMO-like and makes sense of farming.  But I have not managed to make exotics, having all three.  Allows you to choose what to focus your weapon on.  The optimization table only raises the level, and does not allow you to modify attributes or abilities of the weapon.The Mods: they cannot be destroyed, but it is logical because they serve to increase the level of the mod that we want to have equipped, including the exotic ones. I like this system. Specializations: Although there are three, in reality we could say that there are six, because they can be developed into an offensive or defensive specialization.  The fact that two are electronics and one is a tank does not worry me, because we hope that more will come in the future.  For PVP I don't know if they are the most suitable.  I choose the shield.Missions: They have a short duration, being focused to play on a mobile.  They are fun.  In the end, I finished them like Lexington in TD1, running to wait for the enemies at their exit doors.  I expect some Legendary with hunters.The streets: They have a lot of activity and many bosses.  But the loot of these bosses is not much, although it is fun to face them.  I expect a condecoration  for cleaning the streets of so many bosses.Future: I would like to see  hunters and legendaries quests.  Being able to test weapons in the shooting gallery at the base of operations.  Being able to change characters without having to close the game.  The PVP I hope is not affected by the builds but by the player.  Here it will be noticed who uses controller.  I expect more difficulty in the new factions, like in TD1 and see what awaits us in the Endgame",,feedback-and-bugs

I have played on a Pocophone F2 Pro, connected to a mobile network and Wi-Fi, on the beach with the screen and at home with a PS4 controller.  I have only reached level 24.Problems: only one crash and some  lag problems in some macthmaking.Fears: Being a cooperative open world, if the number of players in the streets is not fine-tuned, you may not be able to open any backpack and you may not arrive in time to do any activity.  From what I've seen, the activities respawn in a short time.In love: You have listened to the TD1 community when we asked to be able to have the streets as an open world with other players that are not from our team.  Running in & out of the Main Base is great.  That our character finally speaks is also great.  Now you must remember to include Central Park. 😉Weapons: I have used the same as with TD2, especially AR.  With the shield I thought that Lady Dead would be the best, until I tried the exotic LMG.  It's a combination too deadly .  Having bosses with three types of weakness makes you need three weapin for racha exotic.  It's fun.  The enemies are sponges, yes, it has always been like that, it is part of this game.  There are no guns, although I don't usually use them much.",,feedback-and-bugs

2022-08-01T10:52:40.238000+00:00,211938703591997451,Zycore,"Bugs and feedback I have found:Some backpack or boxes were not able to be interacted with and presented a message saying you are not longer able to interact with this object. Changing graphics mode from low to high and back to low causes the game to crash, when attempting to reload it fails. Removing cache and restarting fixes issue. Battery drain on each of the graphics setting is wild, low allows for about 3 hours of play. Medium allows for about 2.25 hours of playHigh about 90 mins of playFull wack is about 60 mins. It's possible to get a gun stuck in the reload cycle by pressing reload and the fire button on the right side of the screen repeatedly. The only way to fix is to swap guns. Depending on draw distance and graphics settings it possible for you to do no damage with a sniper shot if you are on the edge of draw distance range. When selecting items to dismantle it allows you to select an item but then you can't deselect the item, the tick remains and is deconstructed. Opening the game on 2 mobile devices at the same time does not present you with any errors for a weirdly long time. Both games load the agent and you are able to move around before both crash after about 60 seconds. Swapping from mobile data to WiFi and back to mobile data quickly causes the game to display a infinite loading/reconnection screen. As this is unlikely a real word issue a timeout and reattempt would solve this. When opening a open world cache box, if two agent interact with the item at exactly the same time the box does not open for either and on occasion will display the open animation but drop no items. Killing enemy while they are spawning in rooms or behind doors can cause the doors to get stuck closed and means you can't kill them, preventing progression. Apart from these Dev bugs the game handles really well for a alpha, the environment can seem a bit choppy and flat at times but that is understandable. I enjoyed my play.",,feedback-and-bugs

Noticed that some people were unaware (in the beginning) about dismantle weapon and gear. Due this was never pointed out during gameplay. You had to play around with equipment to find that option.For beginners this is very good place to start. But some of the experience player raising World Tier would be a fun option. So the enemies and agents are becoming less sponge. Not sure if this is already taking in planning for the full version. Only down side issue that I'm not sure this will be resolved is heating up of the mobile device when playing. Just for the record I got OnePlus 7 Pro with a Snapdragon 855.Looking forward to be part of the next testing fase,,feedback-and-bugs

2022-08-01T10:01:29.708000+00:00,874655927142326333,R0bn1x0n,I must say I thoroughly enjoyed testing this game and it was even better than I expected. The game play was excellent once I got used to the controls though I did find them a little fiddly when changing the camera angle (kept hitting the fire or one of theskill buttons though I put that down to my fat thumbs) I may have to invest in a controller. I found the missions to be enjoyable and look forward to tackling even more in the finished game and testing out the other skills. The graphics were excellent even with them not being at max quality. A couple of issues I did find was my phone got very hot rather quickly even though it's an almost new phone so couldn't play it for too long in case it damaged my battery. The other issue was once I started playing I didn't want to put it down! All in all this game will be an excellent addition to the division universe. Well done to the team for what you have achieved so far.🙂,,feedback-and-bugs

Initially we had the likes of battlegrounds and call of duty but THIS is on another level. Perfect loot system (but definitely need to look into the rarity drop rate, getting grey loot for dropping a gold enemy), great incentives with daily and weekly tasks and graphics are awesome, especially for mobile, this makes me more likely to pick up and play rather than getting bored quickly like cod. There could be some improvements made for leveling up mobs and easily switching them between weapons and hardware and more advice and help in weapon building as I really didn't get into it and found it a bit pointless when completing missions in heroic mode as you tend to get the best loot. Some sort of incentive other than an achievement, like much better odds in getting a strong weapon (this may be the case already but it wasn't very clear to me). It was coming to the end of the trial until I started looking into it. All in all this alpha was great. With the instalment of the dark zone and more PvP will make this game miles ahead of anything else I've played on mobile. Very much looking forward to the new trail (if I get invited 😁)",,feedback-and-bugs

Then I had to deal with a lot of game crashes and the turret didn't always line up and aiming with the grenade launcher there you couldn't see the enemies clearly.

Yes, the controller worked, even tho there wasnt any official support yet)The Tutorial Mission was easy, simple but still clever made. It guides you through all of the basics. The story is easy to understand, the cutscenes are sometimes buggy, but overall good.After the Tutorial Mission (and the Finsished Tutorial in the James Farley Post Office) the game is quite open, which i love.Sadly, the NYC Base of Operation currently feels empty and a bit dead. Back in Division1 it made sense to me, as we helped building the whole thing to be what it is now, but in TDResurgence it just felt too empty, but I bet most of it will be resolved in the finished game, as most of the Vendors that are there arent interactible yet.The Rest of the Story currently is good as well, even tho i think i never finished all of the main-missions because i was always occupied with something happening in the Open World.The Menu is perfectly made for mobile users, even with the controller attached it still felt good. I would probably prefer to navigate the menu with my fingers, because it is so simple and easy to master, or at least, easy to navigate pretty fast. But I think people with an external controller would prefer to use the controller to navigate everything.Exept the known lags here and there, the phone turning into an oven, the world not wanting to load all of the time, the enemy AI being more A than I and the little exploit-ish thingy i found here https://discord.com/channels/948237510914486303/948259165783085107/1000872377837695017, there wasnt much to dislike for me.

Just like in division 2 the gunplay is diverse between the gun types, with minor variety within a class. The enemies are tanky. Spongy even. Having to unload a full LMG mag at a purple enemy doesn't feel right. The abilities are very different from one another and from my experience paired well for their specialisations. Specialisations themselves might need to be balanced though, since some seem more useful than others.Gameplay is repetitive. Most looter shooters have either extremely varied, or randomly generated/featuring more RNG. I assume the drop tables will be changed at final release, otherwise people will just farm one or two fastest missions.Even within missions, once I've played them half a dozen times I found myself just prefiering or pretrapping enemy spawn points. Making spawns more varied and/or slightly random might help with that.Exotic gear is much more powerful than standard gear, not just stat-wise, but also by allowing you a different playstyle. I am conflicted on that, as this can be great for character progression, but at the same time being locked into a particular firearm type doesn't sound perfect.",,feedback-and-bugs

Since playing on smartphones are a bit tricky compared to the mouse-view mechanic on PC, one could implement recruitable NPCs. After doing some story missions they would be stationed at your personal base. But you could limit recruiting them to only one at a time and only single-playing gamers who are prone to be easily cornered compared to friends playing in a group. Outfitting them with obtained or built weapons & gear would engage and keep the gamers busy. And (let's face it, you knew it) these NPCs could be outfitted with cosmetic clothes as well. These are my thoughts for now.",,feedback-and-bugs
2022-07-30T09:42:58.205000+00:00,800456931956752394,Sternitzky,"My thoughts about gameplay features. I don't know what features are in the game, but still aren't activated in the Alpha version. Nevertheless I was pondering about features that keep the gamers playing yet to be released The Division: Resurgence. What players keep playing aren't alone friends or foes, the hunt for better weapons & gear or cosmetic clothes. As stated in the questionnaire (yes, I filled it out), even Ubisoft describes the game as a Roleplay Tactical Shooter relying on The Division's praised cover mechanics, so the game stands and falls how particularly the roleplay mechanics are implemented. One of these is base-building, a big deal feature in several successful smartphone games, but also one that was part of the original first title of The Division series. Roleplay features that get you personally attached to keep especially players coming back, who single-play a game (for whatever reason). I don't know whether Resurgence has base-building like The Division 1 or in some different way, but I think Resurgence would definitely benefit from some sort of base-building (again with perks), even if players would get a personal apartment in a skyscraper. Hence we're now at the money-making point, because some sort of base means players can decorate aka personalize it with cosmetic items, if this is one point of income Ubisoft is thinking about. More opportunities for not gameplay-affecting cosmetic items mean simply more income.",,feedback-and-bugs

Even though my character level in the bottom left when moving around says 16, and the enemies are all 16.So it seems my weapons were around 6-7 levels under the max I could have upgrade them. If this at all was a contributor, then I think there needs to be a more suitable and consistent character level tracking.Like, how your character level is tied to your max weapon level, but the max weapon level is still 10 higher than your level?I recognise it says ""it increases with your character level"" so could be seen as ""it'll be higher than your max level, but increase alongside it"", but why? That would just add one more hidden (when not at table) stat to keep track of. And every other division game has gone about it that your max leveled weapon is the level equal to your character...But anyways, I feel that still wouldn't explain why all the enemies in the Deadeye mission felt completely fine, but Deadeye themselves felt like shooting at wall and expecting results 🤭",,feedback-and-bugs

It will ask what device you want to remote install to.**FIX 2**: Force closing the play store app (device settings> Apps) and then clearing the app storage cache before opening the link can help start the download process. If none of those work for you, you'll have to wait for the play store to update.Q5: __I've lost the app page, and can't find it in the store?__A: If you lose the app page, click this link https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ubisoft.the.division.mobile.combat.shooting.open.world.rpgOr you can go back to the original email, it's at the bottomYou can also wishlist the app (click the 2 dots top right) and then you can see it in your wishlist as well.Q6:  __How do I get the agent role/view pins/view message history?__ A: New members should be activated automatically, if you don't get the role please reach out to a moderator or admin.
